# Firework-Barge-Display
This project simulates a firework barge display, where a barge is loaded with fireworks, rockets, and flower-type explosions. The barge can ignite the fireworks, producing a colorful display. The program demonstrates object-oriented principles such as pointers, vectors, and dynamic memory allocation in C++.
